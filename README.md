# 👋 Hi, I’m Kshitij Ghodekar

🎓 I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Software Engineering at the University of Limerick, Ireland, where I’m expanding my skills in modern software architecture, system design, and cutting-edge technologies.

💼 I have 3 years of professional experience as a Full Stack Developer. I’ve built and scaled enterprise-level applications, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and delivered robust, user-focused solutions.

💻 I love creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly digital experiences using modern technologies like React, Next.js, Java, Spring Boot, and more.

🌱 I'm passionate about learning and growing every day — always looking for exciting challenges and opportunities to make an impact.

📬 Whether it’s a job opportunity, collaboration, freelance work, or just a chat — I’d love to hear from you!
